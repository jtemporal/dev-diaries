# GitFichas

Hello! If you just arrived here, I welcome you out of the bottom of my heart! Here you'll find the notes and thoughts around my process for developing the GitFichas website.

## This diary isn't a diary

A little disclaimer before we start: Even though this page is called "diary" it will **not** be updated daily. That is because this project is only worked on my free time, that is, during weekends and holidays.

It also worth mentioning that differently from the articles you [usually find in my blog](https://jtemporal.com/en) that aim to teach someone something most of the time, the goal of this page is to document the development process of GitFichas. Are you going to learn if you read this pages? Probably, yes, but the objective is to show what was done more than teaching, to expose the way I think. Show step-by-step the processes and thinking, even more the anything else document my own learnings.

I hope though that the info contained here will help you in any way. And that, by following along with this temporal sequence of steps you may know what to do if you ever start your project, and preferably de without making the mistakes I did.

## How I do I work on GitFichas

I have a limited time to work on GitFichas, and it is, literally, a side project I do on the weekends. So every new feature you see occur over a few days.

I try my best to separate the activities I need to make and the adjustments so that they can only need one day of work but bigger changes not always work like that. My goal is always to work on GitFichas on Saturday so I can rest on Sunday and be ready for the working week without feeling exhausted or overwhelmed.
