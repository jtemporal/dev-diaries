# Getting it online

To the GitFichas online I followed the same steps I usually do for getting pages online. And if you want to know how I do them there's a tutorial that [teaches you step-by-step available here](https://jtemporal.com/publishing-a-website-with-jekyll/). Here I'm going to focus on other more philosophical things I don't address on the tutorial.

## The project is private

To start, GitFichas is private project, by that I mean, the only person that has access to its source code is me.

Today, there isn't a particular reason for that, but while I was developing it, my idea was to release one or two cards per week only. And to do that, since I didn't have a CMS attached to the code, I would leave the pull requests ready only to merge them on the date I wanted to publish the cards. This way maintaining the code private would have that surprise factor attached to each card.

Today the scheduling of cards no longer holds true, but I'm still not ready to make it open source.
