# Getting it online

To the GitFichas online I followed the same steps I usually do for getting pages online. And if you want to know how I do them there's a tutorial that [teaches you step-by-step available here](https://jtemporal.com/publishing-a-website-with-jekyll/). Here I'm going to focus on other more philosophical things I don't address on the tutorial.
