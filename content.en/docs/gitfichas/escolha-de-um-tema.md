# Picking a theme

This was definitely the easy part of the whole project.

I didn't want to develop the page myself, and there are a lot of reasons why, but here are the two main reasons, the most impactful ones:

- I wanted to have the content online and as fast as possible;
- I also wanted to have it be similar to the stack I was already used to.

And here's why.

## Getting the content live, fast

I believe a lot of blogs from developers never see the light of the day.

Usually, devs want to make their own blog, with the coolest features, high performance and using the framework of the hour.

Instead of focusing on the objective of a blog which is, above all, write *something and publishing it*.

Even though am a developer at heart, I prefer to see any content I make in the way it helps someone: live so others can take advantage of it. That's also why I like to have things go live fast and improve on it slowly.

Getting the content live fast has its benefits:

- **Early feedback:** People tend to be vocal about things that don't work for them or that they think can be improved in some way, these taken with a grain of salt can be really useful;
- **Hypothesis validation:** I always thought people would benefit of a friendly content about Git, one that has simple words, and well structured. The way people having been reacting to them as proof of what I imagined.

It is also worth mentioning that these two benefits don't even touch things like creating a portf√≥lio and learning new skills which are also very welcomed.
