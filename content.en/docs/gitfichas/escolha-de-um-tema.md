# Picking a theme

This was definitely the easy part of the whole project.

I didn't want to develop the page myself, and there are a lot of reasons why, but here are the two main reasons, the most impactful ones:

- I wanted to have the content online and as fast as possible;
- I also wanted to have it be similar to the stack I was already used to.

And here's why.

## Getting the content live, fast

Coming soon in English.

## A stack do GitFichas

Coming soon in English.
