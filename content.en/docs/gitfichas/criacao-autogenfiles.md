One nice day like many others, after creating quite a few repeated files I asked myself (and twitter):

{{< tweet user="jesstemporal" id="1418894698589138948" >}}

This test became [autogenfiles](http://jtemporal.com/autogenfiles?utm_source=devdiaries).

## Where did the necessity rise from

The [portf√≥lio theme](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/) I chose has a particularity: the way you list projects isn't through a collection of posts, and by a [Jekyll Collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), by the way this is the same structure I use for listing Brazilians projects to contribute to for the annual hacktoberfest list I curate every year.

Because of such particularity and because of how Jekyll works, every time I created a new card, I'd need to create a new file inside of 3 different folders:

- `projects`
- `_projects`
- `_posts`

I confess to not understand the inner works of how the folders connected to the listing, but building the website locally I identified the need for creating all the files.

## Configuring and using Autogenfiles on GitFichas

[Autogenfiles](http://jtemporal.com/autogenfiles/?utm_source=devdiaries) is made to be simple.
